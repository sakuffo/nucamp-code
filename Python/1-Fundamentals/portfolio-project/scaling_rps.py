        - Ability to use special moves. For now only one ability will be gained after

    Player vs Computer
    Player can chose to attack with RPS
    Computer will randomly choose RPS
    The two will then be compared
    The winner will be determined and the loser will be marked for death
    Cheat death can avoid death as long as you have enough 'lives'
    As the player wins the oppoents will grow in lives
    The last opponent will have extra abilities (like a double attack)
